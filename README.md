# Project Exam 2

The purpose of this project is to take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect my general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a front-end appliation for a social media company. 

I was given the the following requirements in the form of *User Stories*:
1. A user with a `stud.noroff.no` email may register
2. A registered user may login
3. A registered user may update their avatar and banner
4. A registered user may logout
5. A registered user may view a list of `Posts`
6. A registered user may view a list of `Profiles`
7. A registered user may view a single `Post` by `id`
8. A registered user may view a single `Profile` by `name`
9. A registered user may create a `Post`
10. A registered user may update a `Post` they own
11. A registered user may delete a `Post` they own
12. A registered user may create a `Comment` on any `Post`
13. A registered user may `react` to any `Post` with an emoji
14. A registered user may `follow` and `unfollow` another `Profile`



## Built With

You can list a the tech stack that you've used over here

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Getting Started

### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.

## Contact

This is where you can leave your social links for people to contact you, such as a LinkedIn profile or Twitter link e.g.

[My Twitter page](www.twitter.com)

[My LinkedIn page](www.linkedin.com)

## License

You can link to your license file here if you're using one, or mention what license the codebase falls under. If you're unsure then you can simply delete this section.

## Acknowledgments

This is where you can add any acknowledgements if you'd like, such as to people who have helped you or any code snippets you'd like to mention. You can delete this section if you don't have any acknowledgements to make.
